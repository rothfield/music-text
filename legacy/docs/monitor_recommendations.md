# Monitor Recommendations for Development

This document outlines recommendations for selecting a monitor for software development, with a focus on text clarity, ergonomics, and convenience.

## Primary Recommendation: The Sweet Spot

The most effective and cost-efficient setup for most developers.

- **Type:** 27-inch, 1440p (QHD), IPS Monitor with USB-C
- **Resolution:** 2560x1440 (QHD)
- **Panel:** IPS (In-Plane Switching)
- **Connectivity:** USB-C with Power Delivery (65W or higher)

### Why This Setup Works:

- **Size (27"):** Large enough for comfortable multi-pane layouts without being overwhelming on a standard desk.
- **Resolution (1440p):** The ideal pixel density for sharp text at 27" without requiring fractional scaling on Linux. Provides ample screen real estate.
- **Panel (IPS):** Ensures superior color accuracy and wide viewing angles, reducing eye strain during long sessions.
- **Connectivity (USB-C):** The killer feature for a modern workflow. A single cable can handle video, power delivery to charge a laptop, and data for peripherals connected to the monitor's built-in USB hub. It's a one-cable docking station.

### Recommended Models:

- **Dell UltraSharp (U27xx series):** The industry standard for professional office and development work.
- **Lenovo ThinkVision (P27 or T27 series):** High-quality monitors that pair well with Lenovo laptops.
- **HP Z-series:** HP's professional line, offering similar quality and features.

## Alternative Options

### Premium Choice: 4K for Ultimate Text Clarity

- **Type:** 27-inch or 32-inch, 4K (UHD), IPS Monitor with USB-C
- **Resolution:** 3840x2160 (4K/UHD)
- **Benefit:** Exceptional pixel density makes text appear razor-sharp, similar to a printed page.
- **Trade-off:** Requires display scaling (e.g., `scale 2` in Sway for a 27" model) to keep text readable. This works well but is an extra configuration step.

### Power-User Choice: Ultrawide

- **Type:** 34-inch, 3440x1440 Ultrawide Monitor
- **Benefit:** Excellent for arranging many windows horizontally.
- **Trade-off:** Less vertical screen space, which can be a disadvantage for reading long code files. A standard 16:9 monitor in a vertical (pivoted) orientation is often better for this.

## Buying Advice

### Key Features Checklist (Non-Negotiable)

- **Panel Type:** IPS
- **Resolution:** 1440p (QHD) or 4K (UHD)
- **Connectivity:** USB-C with Power Delivery (65W+)
- **Stand:** Must be fully adjustable (Height, Tilt, and **Pivot**).
- **Screen Finish:** Matte / Anti-glare.

### Buying New vs. Used (in Mexico)

- **New:** Recommended for peace of mind. Buying locally (e.g., from `amazon.com.mx`) provides a warranty and avoids the significant risks of importing (damage, customs fees, airline charges). Expect prices around **$8,000 - $12,000 MXN**.
- **Used (Facebook Marketplace, etc.):** A great way to save 40-60%. High-quality professional monitors are often available. **However, you must test in person before buying.**

### Used Monitor Search & Test Guide

#### Search Terms:

- **General:** `monitor`, `monitor para pc`
- **Size/Resolution:** `monitor 27 pulgadas`, `monitor 1440p`, `monitor QHD`, `monitor 2k`
- **Professional Brands:** `monitor Dell Ultrasharp`, `monitor Lenovo Thinkvision`
- **Key Feature:** `monitor USB-C`, `monitor tipo C`

#### In-Person Testing Checklist:

1.  **Bring your laptop and a USB-C cable.**
2.  **Power On:** Ensure the monitor turns on.
3.  **Connect via USB-C:** Verify that it displays your screen and **charges your laptop**.
4.  **Dead Pixel Test:** Use a website or YouTube video to display full-screen solid colors (white, black, red, green, blue). Inspect closely for any pixels that are the wrong color.
5.  **Check for Scratches:** Use a white background to look for physical damage to the screen.
6.  **Test Buttons:** Press the physical menu, brightness, and power buttons.
7.  **Check Stand:** Ensure all adjustments (height, tilt, pivot) work smoothly.
