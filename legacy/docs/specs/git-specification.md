# Git Integration Specification

## Status
**Draft** - Under Development

## Summary
Define Git integration capabilities for the music-text project, including version control workflows, commit message standards, branch management, and collaboration guidelines.

## Motivation

### Version Control for Musical Notation
Music-text as a notation system benefits from proper version control:
- **Track notation evolution**: Changes to musical compositions over time
- **Collaborative composition**: Multiple users working on the same piece
- **Feature development**: Organized development of notation system features
- **Document history**: Maintain history of specification and implementation changes

### Current State
The project currently uses Git for basic version control but lacks:
- Standardized commit message format
- Clear branching strategy
- Integration with music-text parsing features
- Collaboration workflow documentation

## Detailed Design

### Commit Message Standards

#### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

#### Scopes
- `parser`: Document parsing logic
- `notation`: Notation system handling
- `output`: VexFlow/LilyPond output generation
- `cli`: Command-line interface
- `web`: Web interface
- `specs`: Specification documents

#### Examples
```
feat(parser): implement single-line document parsing

Add support for parsing single-line musical input with 25% 
musical content threshold for better user experience.

Closes #123
```

### Branch Management

#### Main Branches
- `master`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features

#### Supporting Branches
- `feature/*`: New features
- `hotfix/*`: Critical fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation

#### Naming Convention
```
feature/single-line-document-parsing
hotfix/parser-crash-fix
release/v1.2.0
```

### Collaboration Workflow

#### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Create pull request to `develop`
4. Code review and approval
5. Merge to `develop`
6. Delete feature branch

#### Code Review Requirements
- All tests pass
- Documentation updated
- Specification compliance
- Performance considerations reviewed

### Git Integration Features

#### Document Versioning
Future enhancement: Track musical document versions
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct DocumentVersion {
    hash: String,
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    author: String,
    message: String,
    content: Document,
}
```

#### Diff Visualization
Musical notation diff display:
- Visual comparison of staff notation
- Highlight changed notes and rhythms
- Support for merge conflict resolution

## Implementation Strategy

### Repository Structure
```
music-text/
├── .git/
├── .gitignore
├── .github/
│   ├── workflows/
│   └── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
├── src/
├── tests/
├── docs/
│   └── specs/
└── examples/
```

### Git Hooks
- `pre-commit`: Run tests and linting
- `commit-msg`: Validate commit message format
- `pre-push`: Run full test suite

### GitHub Integration
- Automated CI/CD workflows
- Issue templates for bugs and features
- Pull request templates
- Release automation

## Test Plan

### Workflow Tests
- Verify branch protection rules
- Test merge conflict scenarios
- Validate CI/CD pipeline

### Integration Tests
- Document version tracking
- Diff generation accuracy
- Collaboration scenarios

## Backwards Compatibility

This specification defines new workflows and standards without breaking existing Git usage patterns.

## Future Extensions

- **Musical Git**: Version control optimized for musical content
- **Collaborative editing**: Real-time collaborative composition
- **Visual diff tools**: Graphical notation comparison
- **Automated transcription**: Git hooks for notation format conversion
