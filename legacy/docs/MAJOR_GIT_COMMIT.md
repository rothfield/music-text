# Major Git Commit Plan

**Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Commit Type**: Major Feature Release  
**Scope**: Comprehensive architecture upgrade with dual major features  

## Summary

This commit represents a fundamental evolution of the music-text system, adding two major capabilities: sophisticated rhythm processing with dash support, and barline-free consecutive notation parsing. These changes modernize the core parsing pipeline while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Primary Changes

### 1. **Sophisticated Rhythm Processing & Dash Support**
Based on `SESSION_CHANGES.md` - comprehensive FSM upgrade:

#### Core Architecture
- **Added dash (`-`) as first-class musical element** in grammar and model
- **Replaced simple FSM with sophisticated fraction-based rhythm processor**
- **Integrated proven old FSM logic** with modern pipeline architecture
- **Added production-quality tuplet detection and generation**

#### New Dependencies
- Added `fraction = { version = "0.13", features = ["with-serde-support"] }`

#### Key Files Created/Modified
- **NEW**: `src/rhythm_fsm.rs` - Sophisticated FSM with fraction-based durations
- **NEW**: `src/old_models.rs` - Complete degree system and musical element types
- **MODIFIED**: `src/document/grammar.pest` - Added dash element support
- **MODIFIED**: `src/document/model.rs` - Added Dash variant to MusicalElement enum
- **UPGRADED**: LilyPond and VexFlow renderers with tuplet support

### 2. **Consecutive Notation Detection**
Based on `CONSECUTIVE_NOTATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` and `SINGLE_LINE_NOTATION_FEATURE.md`:

#### Feature Overview
- **Barline-free notation parsing**: "SRG", "123", "CDE" work without "|" prefix
- **Automatic system detection**: Identifies Number, Western, or Sargam notation
- **Grammar ambiguity resolution**: Fixed Sargam 'G' mapping (N5→N3)

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Priority parsing**: Consecutive detection runs before grammar parsing
- **System consistency**: All characters must be from same notation system
- **Input validation**: 3+ characters, single-line only, no spaces

#### Key Files
- **NEW**: `src/document/compact_notation_preprocessor.rs` - Preprocessing logic
- **MODIFIED**: `src/document/mod.rs` - Priority parsing implementation
- **MODIFIED**: Multiple tree transformer files for consecutive notation support

## Technical Achievements

### Rhythm Processing Improvements
| Capability | Before | After |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Dash Support | ❌ None | ✅ Full grammar + FSM integration |
| Tuplet Generation | ❌ Basic | ✅ Professional: `\tuplet 3/2 { c4 d8 }` |
| Duration Accuracy | ❌ Approximated | ✅ Exact fractions (no floating point) |
| Complex Rhythms | ❌ Limited | ✅ Irregular tuplets, ties, extensions |

### Notation System Improvements
| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Barline Requirement | ❌ Required "|" prefix | ✅ Optional for simple input |
| System Detection | ❌ Grammar-dependent | ✅ Automatic with consistency validation |
| Sargam Mapping | ❌ "SRmG" → g4 (wrong) | ✅ "SRmG" → e4 (correct N3) |
| Mixed Systems | ❌ Ambiguous results | ✅ Rejected as plain text |

### Architecture Enhancements
- **Clean Pipeline Preserved**: PEST → Parser → FSM → Renderers
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality maintained
- **Professional Output Quality**: Matches established music notation software
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation between simple and complex parsing
