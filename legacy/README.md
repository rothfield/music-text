# Legacy Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation from when the project was focused on creating a text-based notation format standard.

## Project Shift

The project has shifted from:
- **Old focus**: Promoting music-text as a universal notation format standard (like YAML/JSON)
- **New focus**: Building practical tools for textual music notation (implementation details internal)

## What's Archived Here

- `root-docs/`: All the markdown documentation from the project root
- `specs/`: Complete specifications directory including the editor spec
- Original `notation.md` and `MUSIC_TEXT_LANGUAGE_SPECIFICATION.md`

## What Remains Active

In the project root, we kept only:
- `README.md`: New tool suite vision
- `BEAMING_SPEC.md`: Rhythm/beaming implementation details
- `TECH_NOTE_LILYPOND_TABLA_RHYTHM.md`: Rhythm complexities
- `TECH_NOTE_TABLA_NOTATION.md`: Tabla rhythm notation
- `TECH_NOTE_TABLA_TOKENIZATION_PROBLEM.md`: Rhythm parsing challenges

## Reason for Archive

The format specification work is still valuable internally for implementation, but we're no longer positioning music-text as a standard that others should adopt. Instead, we're building tools that make textual music notation practical and useful.
