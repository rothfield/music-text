## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Musicians and composers want to create sargam music notation through a visual WYSIWYG editor that provides real-time parsing and visual feedback as they type. The key advantage over plain text editing is that as users type, each line is immediately parsed and the screen redraws to show proper alignment of staff notation, beat groupings, note attachments, syllables, and octave dots. Users unfamiliar with staff notation should be able to import existing MusicXML files and have them automatically converted to accessible sargam text notation. They should be able to edit content lines visually with immediate visual feedback, use familiar text editing controls (copy/paste, selection, cursor), and view different output formats in tabs below the editor.

### Acceptance Scenarios

## Future Considerations

### Enhanced Typography Features
- **Ligature Support**: For connected note sequences
- **Variable Fonts**: For dynamic weight adjustments
- **Custom Font Loading**: Music-specific typefaces
- **Accessibility**: High contrast and screen reader support
- **Unicode Symbols**: Proper musical ornament characters (`‚àø`, `ùÜù`)

### Intelligent Spacing System *(Future Enhancement)*
- **Adaptive Beat Grouping Spacing**: Automatically adjust horizontal spacing between beat groups based on content complexity and visual density for enhanced readability
- **Syllable-Aware Spacing**: Dynamically expand horizontal space around notes to accommodate syllable text width, ensuring syllables don't overlap with adjacent musical elements
- **Text Width Calculations**: Intelligent measurement of syllable text dimensions to determine minimum required spacing for clean visual presentation
- **Readability Optimization**: Intelligent spacing algorithms that consider note density, ornaments, syllables, and octave markers for optimal visual clarity
- **Dynamic Whitespace Management**: Smart insertion of appropriate whitespace between beat groups to improve musical phrase readability and visual flow, with additional space allocation for syllable text
- **Context-Aware Spacing**: Spacing adjustments that consider surrounding musical elements (barlines, lyrics, grace notes, syllable text) for balanced visual presentation
- **Typography-Driven Spacing**: Spacing calculations based on font metrics and typography standards for professional music notation appearance, including syllable font metrics
- **Phrase-Level Spacing**: Intelligent grouping and spacing at the musical phrase level to enhance comprehension and visual parsing of complex notation with syllable considerations
- **Adaptive Layout Engine**: Dynamic spacing system that adjusts in real-time based on content changes, maintaining optimal readability as users edit and add syllables to notes
- **Comprehensive Collision Avoidance**: System-wide collision detection and prevention across all visual elements including notes, syllables, ornaments, octave dots, grace notes, beat groupings, barlines, and lyrics to avoid unpleasant visual overlaps throughout the layout engine

### Layout Engine & Collision System *(Future Enhancement)*
- **Universal Collision Detection**: Comprehensive system tracking bounding boxes and spatial relationships of all visual elements (notes, syllables, ornaments, octave dots, grace notes, beat groupings, barlines, lyrics, tala markers)
- **Hierarchical Collision Priority**: Intelligent prioritization system determining which elements should move or resize when collisions are detected (e.g., spacing adjusts before font size reduction)
- **Multi-Layer Collision Management**: Separate collision handling for different visual layers (baseline notes, above-note ornaments, below-note syllables, beat group arcs, measure-level elements)
- **Predictive Collision Avoidance**: Anticipate potential collisions during real-time editing and proactively adjust layout before conflicts occur
- **Graceful Degradation**: When space is extremely limited, provide intelligent fallback strategies (syllable abbreviation, stacked elements, font size reduction) rather than overlapping
- **Cross-Element Spacing**: Maintain minimum clearance between different types of elements based on typography standards and visual design principles

### Performance Optimizations
- **CSS Grid**: For complex notation layouts
- **GPU Acceleration**: For smooth arc rendering and collision detection
- **Lazy Loading**: For large notation documents
- **Spatial Indexing**: Efficient data structures for rapid collision detection across many elements
- **Intelligent Caching**: Cache spacing calculations, typography metrics, syllable text width measurements, and collision detection results for improved performance
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Gradually apply intelligent spacing as processing resources allow, prioritizing critical collision avoidance for immediate readability
- **Text Measurement Optimization**: Efficient syllable text width calculation algorithms to minimize performance impact during real-time editing
- **Incremental Layout Updates**: Only recalculate collisions and spacing for affected areas during editing, not the entire document
