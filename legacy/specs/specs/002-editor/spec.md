3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Clarified: music-text notation editor (not traditional staff notation)
   � Target users: musicians working with text-based notation
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: editing capabilities - creation, modification, deletion?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Basic editing workflow scenarios defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Core editing capabilities specified
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Document, Content, User Actions identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties - needs clarification on editor type"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Notation System Definition *(mandatory)*

**IMPORTANT: WE ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTING MUSIC-TEXT FORMAT AS FORMAT TYPE.**

### Music-Text Notation System
This editor supports the **music-text notation system**, a text-based musical notation format that accommodates multiple pitch systems including traditional Sargam notation (a variant of Bhatkande's system used extensively at the AACM from the 1970s onward) and other text-based musical representations.

The complete notation specification is detailed in [notation.md](../../notation.md), which covers:
- Multiple pitch notation systems (Sargam, Number, ABC, DoReMi, Hindi/Devanagari)
- Spatial rhythm representation using dashes and spaces
- Hierarchical document structure with content lines, upper/lower annotation lines
- Ornament notation, tala integration, and microtonal support
- Examples and grammar for the complete notation language

#### Key Capabilities
- **Multiple pitch systems**: Support for various notation traditions within a unified format
- **Text-based**: Entirely representable as plain text for accessibility and portability
- **Spatial annotations**: Octave markers, slurs, ornaments positioned above/below content
- **Rhythmic flexibility**: Proportional rhythm via dash counting and beat grouping
- **Cultural integration**: Accommodates Indian classical, Western, and experimental music traditions

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Musicians need to create, modify, and manage music-text notation through an interactive editing interface that allows them to input musical information in text format and see the rendered notation in real-time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new editing session, **When** musician opens the editor, **Then** they see a blank workspace ready for Sargam notation input with pitch system selector
2. **Given** musician types "Sa Re Ga Ma", **When** they press space or enter, **Then** the Sargam syllables are immediately rendered as visual notation
3. **Given** existing Sargam notation is loaded, **When** musician modifies syllables or adds ornaments, **Then** changes are immediately visible in both text and rendered output
4. **Given** musician enters invalid Sargam syntax, **When** they move cursor away, **Then** system highlights errors and provides correction suggestions
5. **Given** musician has created complete Sargam composition, **When** they save their work, **Then** notation is persisted with selected pitch system and metadata
6. **Given** musician makes editing error, **When** they trigger undo functionality, **Then** previous Sargam notation state is restored including ornaments and timing

### Edge Cases
- What happens when invalid Sargam syllables or non-existent ornaments are entered?
- How does system handle conflicting pitch system requirements within a single composition?
- What occurs when microtonal intervals exceed the selected temperament's capabilities?
- How are unsaved changes handled during unexpected session termination?
- How does editor handle ambiguous gamaka notation that could be interpreted multiple ways?
- What happens when tala cycles don't align with entered rhythmic patterns?
- How does system handle switching between different pitch systems mid-composition?
- What occurs when ornament notation conflicts with basic Sargam syllable placement?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a user interface for music-text notation creation and modification
- **FR-002**: System MUST display notation changes in real-time as musician types music-text
- **FR-003**: Musicians MUST be able to save their music-text notation and retrieve it later
- **FR-004**: System MUST support undo/redo operations for notation edits
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate music-text syntax and provide feedback for invalid notation
- **FR-006**: System MUST support Sargam notation format for editing (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni syllables and equivalents)
- **FR-007**: System MUST render Sargam notation into visual musical representation in real-time
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide cursor positioning and selection within Sargam text content
- **FR-009**: System MUST support multiple pitch systems (12-tone, 22-shruti, just intonation, custom temperaments)
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate Sargam syntax including rhythmic patterns, ornaments, and tala structures
- **FR-011**: System MUST support octave markings, accidentals, and microtonal intervals in Sargam notation
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle ornament notation for gamakas and other embellishments
- **FR-013**: Musicians MUST be able to work in single-user editing mode (collaboration features not specified for initial scope)
- **FR-014**: System MUST support basic file operations (save, load, export) for Sargam notation files

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Sargam Document**: Represents the Sargam notation being edited, contains syllable sequences, ornaments, tala, and pitch system metadata
- **Notation Edit**: Represents musician modifications to Sargam text, includes syllable changes, ornament additions, and rhythmic adjustments
- **Pitch System**: Represents the active temperament (12-tone, 22-shruti, just intonation, etc.) and associated tuning parameters
- **Editing Session**: Represents current editing state, tracks active Sargam document, selected pitch system, and musician progress
- **Cursor State**: Represents position within Sargam notation text, syllable selection, and view preferences
- **Rendered Output**: Represents visual musical representation generated from Sargam notation with applied pitch system
- **Ornament**: Represents gamaka and other embellishment markings applied to Sargam syllables
- **Tala Structure**: Represents rhythmic cycle framework governing the temporal organization of Sargam notation
