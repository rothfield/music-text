# Music Text Style Guide

Typography and 'engraving' principles to make beautiful music-text output for musicians to read.

This spec exists to document general typography of music text. It will be improved. DoReMi-scripts CSS is probably the best guide, but for now we won't address that.

## Beat Groups
- **Lower loops**: 2+ elements get arc below (`--lower-loop-char-count`)
- **Division numbers**: Show above middle notes for odd (3,5,7,9) + numbers >9 (`--show-divisions`)

## Typography
- **Pitches**: Standard size, monospace
- **Lyrics**: Smaller, secondary text
- **Division numbers**: 0.7em, italic, gray (#666)

## Rules
- Beat groups: 2+ consecutive pitches/dashes get lower arc
