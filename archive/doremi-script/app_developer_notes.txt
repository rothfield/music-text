NOTE:This project does NOT provide a web server.
Note that in development mode, boot dev provides a web server
In production, my server uses nginx.


# start development environment
boot dev

# compile for production. Production code is in target
boot css-min cljs -O advanced
boot cljs -O advanced

# Use node's http-server to test the production code
# install
sudo npm install -g http-server

The following minifier is required by the build.sh script
sudo npm install -g minifier
# Test production code
http-server target

The script build.css compiles in production mode, minifies, sets script tag async, and updates manifest.
To deploy to production:

git pull; ./build.sh


Running in development mode:

boot dev    
starts a web server and serves up the app on port 3000
and reloads and recompiles cljs as it changes
