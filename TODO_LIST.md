# TODO List

## High Priority

1. **Purge semitones use old transposition system** - Remove semitone-based transposition system and revert to the old transposition system that was working

2. **Execute Git Repository Reorganization Plan** - Implement the structured commit strategy outlined in `GIT_REORG_PLAN.md`:
   - Phase 1: Infrastructure commit (parsing, pitch coverage, converters)
   - Phase 2: API enhancement commit (notation-to-SVG endpoint)
   - Phase 3: Documentation commit (research notes)
   - Clean up build artifacts and update .gitignore if needed
