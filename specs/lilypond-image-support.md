# LilyPond Image Support

## Summary

Add publication-quality notation rendering to the music-text web interface to complement the existing VexFlow draft preview. Users need both instant feedback for composition (VexFlow) and professional validation for final output (LilyPond images).

## Motivation

### Current State: Draft Preview Only

The music-text web interface provides instant feedback through VexFlow draft preview but lacks publication-quality visual validation:

**What Works:**
- **VexFlow (Tab 8)**: Instant draft preview, good for composition and iteration
- **LilyPond Source (Tab 6)**: Professional source code generation
- **Pipeline Visualization**: Complete text → AST → output transformation stages

**What's Missing:**
- **LilyPond Images (Tab 7)**: Currently shows "not yet implemented"
- **Publication Quality Validation**: Users cannot verify final output appearance
- **Professional Workflow Completion**: No path from draft to publication validation

### The Problem: Incomplete Validation Loop

**Current User Experience:**
1. User types musical idea: `|1 2 3 4|`
2. **VexFlow**: Instant draft preview (sufficient for composition)
3. **LilyPond**: Source code only (`{ c4 d4 e4 f4 }`)
4. **Gap**: Cannot validate what the professional output looks like
5. **Workaround**: Copy LilyPond source to external tool for visual validation

**Desired User Experience:**
1. User types musical idea: `|1 2 3 4|`
2. **VexFlow**: Instant draft preview (composition feedback)
3. **LilyPond**: Professional image rendering (publication validation)
4. **Comparison**: User sees draft vs publication quality side-by-side
5. **Confidence**: User knows exactly what the final output will look like

### Why Both Renderers Are Essential

This is not about choosing VexFlow OR LilyPond - it's about providing a complete professional workflow:

**VexFlow (Draft Preview):**
- Instant feedback during composition
- Interactive editing and iteration
- "Good enough" quality for development work
- Real-time responsiveness

**LilyPond Images (Publication Quality):**
- Professional typesetting and spacing
- Print-ready accuracy
- Publication/sharing validation
- Industry-standard notation quality

**Analogy**: Google Docs live editing + Print Preview, InDesign layout + Preview mode, CAD wireframe + rendered view.

### Target Users & Use Cases

**Sketch-first Composers:**
- Need rapid iteration (VexFlow) + final validation (LilyPond)
- Want to see the difference between draft and publication output
- Require confidence in final output before sharing/printing

**Learning Musicians:**
- Understand the progression from text input → draft → professional notation  
- Validate that their text input produces the intended musical result
- Learn notation standards through visual feedback

**Professional Users:**
- Require publication-quality output for scores, lead sheets, educational materials
- Need to verify notation accuracy before final delivery
- Want professional typesetting validation within their workflow

**Developer Contributors:**
- Need visual validation of the complete text → notation pipeline
- Debug rendering differences between VexFlow and LilyPond output
- Validate notation system accuracy (Sargam/Number/Western)

## Detailed Design

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- **R1**: Generate publication-quality images from music-text input
- **R2**: Display images in Tab 7 of existing web interface
- **R3**: Support all notation systems (Sargam, Number, Western)
- **R4**: Handle LilyPond compilation errors gracefully
- **R5**: Maintain existing VexFlow instant preview functionality (no regressions)

#### Performance Requirements  
- **P1**: VexFlow draft preview remains instant (< 100ms)
- **P2**: LilyPond image generation completes within reasonable time (< 10 seconds)
- **P3**: Server remains responsive during image generation (non-blocking)
- **P4**: Support concurrent image generation without resource exhaustion

#### User Experience Requirements
- **UX1**: Clear distinction between draft (VexFlow) and publication (LilyPond) modes
- **UX2**: Loading states communicate progress during slower operations
- **UX3**: Error messages are understandable and actionable
- **UX4**: Workflow enhancement, not disruption of existing patterns

#### Security Requirements
- **S1**: Validate all user input before LilyPond compilation
- **S2**: Prevent resource exhaustion attacks through input/process limits
- **S3**: Secure handling of temporary files and external process execution
- **S4**: No exposure of server file system or sensitive information

### Architecture Integration

The existing web interface provides the foundation:
- **8-tab pipeline visualizer** showing complete text → notation transformation
- **Tab 7 "LilyPond SVG"** placeholder ready for image display
- **Backend LilyPondGenerator** infrastructure already exists
- **API response structure** may include image data/URLs

This feature completes the originally intended architecture rather than adding new concepts.

### Implementation Alternatives

#### Alternative 1: Inline API Response
**Approach**: Extend existing `/api/parse` endpoint to include image data

```javascript
// API Response
{
  "lilypond": "{ c4 d4 e4 f4 }",
  "lilypond_svg": "<svg>...</svg>",  // Base64 or direct SVG content
  "vexflow": {...}
}
```

**Pros**: 
- Single request for all pipeline stages
- Maintains existing unified architecture
- Simple client implementation

**Cons**:
- Large response payloads with embedded images
- Blocking request until image generation complete
- Timeout issues for complex notation

#### Alternative 2: Image URL Response (doremi-script approach)
**Approach**: Generate images server-side, return URLs to client

```javascript
// API Response  
{
  "lilypond": "{ c4 d4 e4 f4 }",
  "lilypond_image_url": "/generated/abc123.svg",
  "vexflow": {...}
}
```

**Pros**:
- Smaller API response payloads
- Browser-native image caching
- Can support multiple formats (SVG, PNG)
- Easier debugging (images accessible via direct URL)

**Cons**:
- Additional file serving infrastructure  
- Image cleanup/garbage collection needed
- URL generation and management complexity

#### Alternative 3: WebSocket Streaming
**Approach**: Real-time streaming of generation progress and results

```javascript
// WebSocket Messages
{ "type": "lilypond_generation_started" }
{ "type": "lilypond_generation_progress", "step": "compiling" }
{ "type": "lilypond_generation_complete", "image_data": "..." }
```

**Pros**:
- Real-time progress feedback  
- Non-blocking user interface
- Can stream incremental results
- Excellent user experience for slow operations

**Cons**:
- WebSocket infrastructure complexity
- Connection management and reconnection logic
- Additional client-side state management

#### Alternative 4: Polling with Async Jobs
**Approach**: Submit generation job, poll for completion

```javascript
// Submit job
POST /api/generate-lilypond-image → { "job_id": "xyz" }

// Poll for result
GET /api/job/xyz → { "status": "complete", "image_url": "/generated/abc.svg" }
```

**Pros**:
- Non-blocking user interface
- Can handle very long generation times  
- Progress tracking capability
- Scales well under load

**Cons**:
- Additional polling infrastructure
- Job queue and state management
- More complex client implementation

#### Alternative 5: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
**Approach**: Stream generation updates via SSE

```javascript
// SSE Stream
data: {"type": "generation_started"}
data: {"type": "generation_complete", "image_url": "/generated/abc.svg"}
```

**Pros**:
- Real-time updates without WebSocket complexity
- Browser-native SSE support
- Automatic reconnection handling

**Cons**:
- One-way communication only
- SSE infrastructure requirements
- Limited browser compatibility (older versions)

## Rationale and Alternatives

### Why Add LilyPond Images?

**Completes Professional Workflow**: Bridges the gap between draft composition and publication validation

**User-Requested Functionality**: Tab 7 exists but shows "not implemented" - users expect this feature

**Industry Standard**: Professional music notation tools provide both draft and publication modes  

**Existing Infrastructure**: Backend LilyPondGenerator already exists, minimal new dependencies

### Why Not Alternative Approaches?

**VexFlow-Only Strategy (Status Quo)**:
- **Pro**: Simple, fast, already works
- **Con**: Draft quality only, no publication validation
- **Verdict**: Insufficient for professional use cases

**External Tool Integration**:
- **Pro**: No additional implementation complexity
- **Con**: Breaks workflow, requires context switching
- **Verdict**: Poor user experience, defeats integrated pipeline vision

**Client-Side LilyPond (WASM)**:
- **Pro**: No server-side processes, instant rendering
- **Con**: Large bundle size, complex LilyPond → WASM compilation
- **Verdict**: Technical complexity outweighs benefits for current scope

**Replace VexFlow with LilyPond**:
- **Pro**: Single high-quality renderer
- **Con**: Loses instant feedback, breaks composition workflow
- **Verdict**: Eliminates key advantage of draft preview system

## Unresolved Questions

### Implementation Approach
- **Which transport mechanism** provides the best user experience? (URLs vs embedded vs streaming)
- **Debouncing strategy**: How long should we wait after typing stops before generating images?
- **Caching approach**: Should we cache generated images, and if so, what's the eviction strategy?
- **Error recovery**: How should failed image generation be communicated and recovered from?

### User Experience Design
- **Loading states**: What's the optimal way to show generation progress?
- **Image sizing**: Fixed dimensions vs responsive scaling for different viewports?
- **Error display**: How to show LilyPond compilation errors without disrupting workflow?
- **Format options**: Should users choose between SVG/PNG, or is one format sufficient?

### Performance Optimization
- **Resource limits**: How many concurrent image generations should we allow?
- **Generation optimization**: Can we speed up LilyPond compilation for typical use cases?
- **Bandwidth considerations**: What's the impact of image data on mobile/slow connections?
- **Server scaling**: How does image generation affect server resource planning?

### Feature Scope
- **Download functionality**: Should users be able to save generated images directly?
- **Print optimization**: Do we need high-DPI images for print use cases?
- **Batch generation**: Should we support generating images for multiple inputs simultaneously?
- **Format variety**: Beyond basic notation, do we need to support different LilyPond output styles?
