**Feature Branch**: `002-editor`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "editor" - Clarified as music-text notation editor (not staff notation)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Description provided: "editor"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: music-text notation editing, user interface, document manipulation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Clarified: music-text notation editor (not traditional staff notation)
   � Target users: musicians working with text-based notation
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: editing capabilities - creation, modification, deletion?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Basic editing workflow scenarios defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Core editing capabilities specified
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Document, Content, User Actions identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties - needs clarification on editor type"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Musicians need to create, modify, and manage music-text notation through an interactive editing interface that allows them to input musical information in text format and see the rendered notation in real-time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new editing session, **When** musician opens the editor, **Then** they see a blank workspace ready for music-text notation input
2. **Given** existing music-text notation is loaded, **When** musician makes modifications to the text, **Then** changes are immediately visible in both text and rendered notation
3. **Given** musician has created notation, **When** they save their work, **Then** music-text content is persisted and available for future sessions
4. **Given** musician makes an input error, **When** they trigger undo functionality, **Then** previous notation state is restored

### Edge Cases
- What happens when invalid music-text notation syntax is entered?
- How does system handle malformed musical structures or rhythms?
- What occurs when notation becomes too complex for real-time rendering?
- How are unsaved changes handled during unexpected session termination?
- How does editor handle ambiguous musical notation that could be interpreted multiple ways?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a user interface for music-text notation creation and modification
- **FR-002**: System MUST display notation changes in real-time as musician types music-text
- **FR-003**: Musicians MUST be able to save their music-text notation and retrieve it later
- **FR-004**: System MUST support undo/redo operations for notation edits
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate music-text syntax and provide feedback for invalid notation
- **FR-006**: System MUST support music-text notation format for editing (text-based musical representation)
- **FR-007**: System MUST render music-text notation into visual musical representation
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide cursor positioning and selection within music-text content
- **FR-009**: Musicians MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: collaboration features - single user or multi-user editing?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file operations - import/export capabilities for music-text files?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Music Document**: Represents the music-text notation being edited, contains notation text and musical metadata
- **Notation Edit**: Represents musician modifications to music-text, includes type of musical change and affected notation
- **Editing Session**: Represents current editing state, tracks active music document and musician progress
- **Cursor State**: Represents position within music-text notation, selection, and view preferences
- **Rendered Output**: Represents visual musical representation generated from music-text notation
