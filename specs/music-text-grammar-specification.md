# Music Text Grammar Specification

## Overview

This specification defines the formal grammar for the music-text notation language, supporting multiple pitch notation systems with spatial rhythm representation and hierarchical document structure.

## Grammar Rules (EBNF)

### Document Structure

```ebnf
document = blank_lines* (stave (blank_lines stave)*)? blank_lines?

stave = upper_line* content_line (lower_line | lyrics_line)* (blank_lines | (whitespace* newline)* EOI)

blank_lines = newline (whitespace* newline)+
newline = "\n"
whitespace = " "
```

### Content Lines

```ebnf
content_line = line_number? barline? measure (barline measure)* barline? newline

measure = beat+
beat = simple_beat | delimited_beat

simple_beat = (pitch | dash | space)+
delimited_beat = overline_marker newline (pitch | dash | space)+ newline

pitch = pitch_char accidental?
pitch_char = sargam_note | number_note | abc_note | doremi_note | hindi_note
accidental = "#" | "b"
dash = "-"
space = " "
```

### Annotation Lines

```ebnf
annotation_line = upper_line | lower_line | lyrics_line

upper_line = upper_line_element+ (newline | EOI)
lower_line = lower_line_element+ (newline | EOI)
lyrics_line = syllable+ (newline | EOI)
```

### Upper Line Elements

```ebnf
upper_line_element = upper_octave_marker | slur | ornament | chord | mordent | tala | space | unknown_upper

upper_octave_marker = "." | "*" | ":"
slur = "_"+
ornament = "<" pitch+ ">" | pitch+
chord = "[" chord_symbol "]"
mordent = "~"
tala = "+" | "0" | digit
space = " "+
unknown_upper = !upper_octave_marker !("_") !space !ornament !chord !mordent !tala ANY+
```

### Lower Line Elements

```ebnf
lower_line_element = lower_octave_marker | beat_group_indicator | syllable | space | unknown_lower

lower_octave_marker = "." | ":"
beat_group_indicator = "_" "_"+   // exactly two or more consecutive underscores (minimum length: 2)
syllable = letter+ (letter | digit | "'" | "-")*   // alphanumeric with apostrophes and hyphens
space = " "+
unknown_lower = !lower_octave_marker !("_" "_") !space !syllable ANY+
```

### Notation Systems

```ebnf
sargam_note = "S" | "R" | "G" | "M" | "P" | "D" | "N" | 
              "s" | "r" | "g" | "m" | "p" | "d" | "n"

number_note = "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7"

abc_note = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" |
           "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g"

doremi_note = "D" | "R" | "M" | "F" | "S" | "L" | "T" |
              "d" | "r" | "m" | "f" | "s" | "l" | "t"

hindi_note = "‡§∏" | "‡§∞" | "‡§ó" | "‡§Æ" | "‡§™" | "‡§ß" | "‡§®"
```

### Barlines and Structure

```ebnf
barline = "|" | "||" | "|:" | ":|" | "|]"
line_number = digit+ "."
```

## Spatial Relationship Rules

### Octave Markers
- **Position determines direction**: 
  - Pre-content annotation = raise octave (upper)
  - Post-content annotation = lower octave (lower)
- **Alignment**: Markers align spatially with content notes
- **Symbols**: `.` (single octave), `:` (double octave), `*` (alternative)

### Slurs vs Beat Groups
- **Slurs**: `_____` in upper_line = musical phrasing
- **Beat Groups**: `_____` in lower_line = rhythmic grouping (beat_group_indicator)
- **Same symbol, different semantic meaning based on spatial context**

### Lower Line Elements
- **Lower octave markers**: `.` (single octave down), `:` (double octave down)
- **Beat group indicators**: `__` (minimum 2) or more consecutive underscores for rhythmic grouping
- **Syllables**: Text elements for spatial alignment (lyrics, tabla bols)
- **Spaces**: For alignment with content above

### Syllable Assignment
- **In lower_line**: Syllables can appear for spatial alignment below notes
- **In lyrics_line**: Traditional lyric lines with syllable-to-note assignment
- **Format**: `he-llo world sing-ing` with hyphens and apostrophes supported

## Test Cases

### Document with Title/Author
```
Input: 
Title: Amazing Grace | Author: John Newton
Tonic: G

|1 2 3 4|
Expected: Title "Amazing Grace", Author "John Newton", directives, single stave
```

### Document with Separate Title Line
```
Input: 
Amazing Grace
Author: John Newton
Tonic: G

|1 2 3 4|
Expected: Title "Amazing Grace", directives, single stave
```

### Basic Notation
```
Input: |1 2 3 4|
Expected: Single measure with four quarter notes
```

### Rhythm Extensions
```
Input: |1-- 2- 3 4|  
Expected: 1 (dotted half), 2 (quarter), 3 (eighth), 4 (eighth)
```

### Spatial Octaves
```
Input: 
    ‚Ä¢   ‚Ä¢
|1 2 3 4|
    ‚Ä¢
Expected: Notes 1,3 raised octave, note 4 lowered octave
```

### Mordents and Ornaments
```
Input:
~   ~   ~
|1 2 3 4|
Expected: Mordents aligned above notes 1, 2, 3
Rendering: Use musical mordent symbol ùÜù (&#x1D19D;) for GUI display
```

### Lower Line Elements
```
Input:
|1 2 3 4|
.   ___  dha
Expected: Lower octave marker on note 1, beat grouping on notes 3-4, syllable "dha" aligned with note 4
```

### Multiple Staves
```
Input:
|1 2 3 4|

|5 6 7 1|
Expected: Two separate staves
```

## Implementation Requirements

### Parser Architecture
1. **Phase 1**: Parse structural elements (content vs annotation)
2. **Phase 2**: Classify annotations based on position and content
3. **Error Handling**: Preserve line/column positions for semantic errors

### Grammar Constraints
- `content_line` must only match lines with musical pitches/beats
- `annotation_line` uses negative lookahead `!content_line`
- Single notation system per document
- Whitespace significant for beat separation

### Semantic Classification
```rust
fn classify_annotation_line(line: &AnnotationLine, position: Position) -> LineType {
    match position {
        PreContent if contains_octave_markers(line) => UpperOctave,
        PostContent if contains_octave_markers(line) => LowerOctave,
        _ if contains_syllables(line) => Lyrics,
        _ => Mixed
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Parsing Errors
- Structural grammar violations
- Invalid character sequences
- Malformed barlines or measures

### Semantic Errors  
- Mixed notation systems in single document
- Misaligned spatial annotations
- Invalid octave marker placement
