## Pre-Rename Checklist

### 1. Backup and Documentation

## Rename Process

### 1. GitHub Repository Settings
1. Navigate to repository Settings
2. Scroll to "Repository name" section
3. Change name from `notation_parser` to `music-text`
4. Confirm the rename

### 2. Local Repository Updates
```bash
# Update remote URL for all local clones
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/[username]/music-text.git

# Verify the change
git remote -v
```

### 3. Clone URL Updates
- **Old**: `https://github.com/[username]/notation_parser.git`

## Important Notes

### GitHub Automatic Redirects

- Backup documentation allows restoration of previous state
- Monitor for any broken integrations in first 24-48 hours
