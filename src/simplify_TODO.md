 input. The parser is correctly preserving the vertical
  spacing structure.

  The outline showing:
  space
  line
  line
  line
  line
  musical-line

  Actually makes sense now - it's capturing:
  - The spaces after "Title"
  - Empty line 2
  - Empty line 3
  - Line 4 remnants (after .S consumed)
  - Empty line 5
  - Musical line 6 with |SS

  So the parser is working correctly - it's preserving the exact
  vertical layout including all the blank lines, which maintains
  the spatial relationships needed for floating element attachment.

> how does that generate so many lines?

● You're right to question this! Let me count the actual lines in
  your input:

    Title     <- Line 1
              <- Line 2 (empty)

   .S         <- Line 3
              <- Line 4 (empty)
  |SS         <- Line 5

  That's only 5 lines total. But the outline shows:

  nodes
    space     <- ??
    line      <- ??
    line      <- ??
    line      <- ??
    line      <- ??
    musical-line  <- This should be line 5 with |SS

  That's 6 nodes for 5 lines, which doesn't make sense!

  The issue seems to be that the parser is creating extra nodes
  somewhere. Let me check what's actually happening by looking at
  the tokens more carefully.

  Looking at the flattener.yaml output I saw earlier, it showed
  nodes for lines 1, 2, 3 with various whitespace tokens. But
  somehow we're getting more line nodes than actual input lines.

  There might be a bug in how group_nodes_into_lines_and_beats is
  counting or processing the lines. It could be:
  1. Creating duplicate nodes for some lines
  2. Splitting single lines into multiple nodes
  3. Creating phantom nodes from token processing artifacts

  This definitely looks like a bug in the line processing logic -
  we shouldn't get more nodes than input lines!

> should we simplify? end up with:  startline ws word ws endline 
  startline endline startline pitch S endpitch    ?

● Yes! That kind of simplification makes a lot of sense. Instead of
   the current complex hierarchy with floating element attachment
  phases, you're suggesting a much more direct tokenization:

  Current complex approach:
  Title -> metadata extraction -> floating element attachment ->
  spatial inference -> musical structuring

  Your simplified approach:
  startline ws word ws endline startline endline startline pitch S
  endpitch

  This would be:
  - More predictable
  - Easier to debug
  - Less prone to the line-counting bugs we're seeing
  - Clearer about what each token represents
  - No mysterious space/line node artifacts

  The spatial relationships could still be preserved through the
  positioning info (row/col) on each token, but without all the
  complex phase processing that's creating structural
  inconsistencies.

  Benefits:
  - Direct mapping: input text → token stream
  - No lost tokens or phantom nodes
  - Simpler to understand and maintain
  - Still preserves spatial information for LilyPond generation

  Trade-off:
  - Lose the sophisticated floating element attachment
  - Would need to handle spatial relationships at the LilyPond
  generation level instead

  But given the current complexity and bugs, this simpler approach
  might be much more reliable. The spatial relationship inference
  could happen during LilyPond conversion rather than during
  parsing.

  Would you like to try this simplified tokenization approach?

> The spatial relationship inference
    could happen during LilyPond conversion rather than during
    parsing.  --- YES. but, it would be nice to be able to SEE what
   are pitches and NOT

● Exactly! You want the best of both worlds:

  Simple, clean tokenization without the complex multi-phase
  parsing, BUT pitch recognition so you can visually distinguish
  musical content from text.

  So instead of the current complex pipeline, something like:

  Input: " .S\n|SS"
  Tokens: [startline, ws, symbol("."), pitch("S"), endline,
  barline("|"), pitch("S"), pitch("S")]

  Benefits:
  - Clean token stream (no phantom nodes)
  - Pitch tokens are clearly marked - you can see what's musical
  vs. text
  - Spatial info preserved (row/col on each token)
  - No complex floating element attachment phase
  - Spatial relationships handled later in LilyPond converter

  For visualization:
  - PITCH tokens get highlighted/colored differently
  - You can easily see the musical content structure
  - Outline shows clear pitch vs. non-pitch distinction

  For LilyPond generation:
  - Spatial relationship inference happens there
  - . at (3,1) attaches to S at (5,1) during conversion
  - Much simpler parser, complexity moved to where it's actually
  needed

  This keeps the pitch recognition benefit (seeing what's musical)
  while eliminating the parsing complexity that's creating
  structural issues.

  The key insight: classification good, complex relationships bad
  at the parsing stage.

● I'll simplify the parser to focus on clean tokenization with
  pitch recognition, moving the spatial relationship inference to
  the LilyPond conversion stage.
